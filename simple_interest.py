Define three variables in this file:
principal with a value of 1000 (representing $1000),
rate with a value of 0.05 (representing 5% annual interest rate),
time with a value of 3 (representing 3 years).
Calculate the simple interest using the formula provided and store the result in a variable named interest.
Print the calculated interest in a format: The simple interest is: [interest].
